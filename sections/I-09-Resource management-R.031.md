### <a name="Rr-smart"></a>R.31: If you have non-`std` smart pointers, follow the basic pattern from `std`

##### Reason

The rules in the following section also work for other kinds of third-party and custom smart pointers and are very useful for diagnosing common smart pointer errors that cause performance and correctness problems.
You want the rules to work on all the smart pointers you use.

Any type (including primary template or specialization) that overloads unary `*` and `->` is considered a smart pointer:

* If it is copyable, it is recognized as a reference-counted `shared_ptr`.
* If it is not copyable, it is recognized as a unique `unique_ptr`.

##### Example

    // use Boost's intrusive_ptr
    #include <boost/intrusive_ptr.hpp>
    void f(boost::intrusive_ptr<widget> p)  // error under rule 'sharedptrparam'
    {
        p->foo();
    }

    // use Microsoft's CComPtr
    #include <atlbase.h>
    void f(CComPtr<widget> p)               // error under rule 'sharedptrparam'
    {
        p->foo();
    }

Both cases are an error under the [`sharedptrparam` guideline](I-09-Resource%20management-R.030.md#Rr-smartptrparam):
`p` is a `Shared_ptr`, but nothing about its sharedness is used here and passing it by value is a silent pessimization;
these functions should accept a smart pointer only if they need to participate in the widget's lifetime management. Otherwise they should accept a `widget*`, if it can be `nullptr`. Otherwise, and ideally, the function should accept a `widget&`.
These smart pointers match the `Shared_ptr` concept, so these guideline enforcement rules work on them out of the box and expose this common pessimization.
