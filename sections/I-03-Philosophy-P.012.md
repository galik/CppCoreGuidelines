### <a name="Rp-tools"></a>P.12: Use supporting tools as appropriate

##### Reason

There are many things that are done better "by machine".
Computers don't tire or get bored by repetitive tasks.
We typically have better things to do than repeatedly do routine tasks.

##### Example

Run a static analyzer to verify that your code follows the guidelines you want it to follow.

##### Note

See

* [Static analysis tools](???)
* [Concurrency tools](I-12-Concurrency%20and%20Parallelism-CP.009.md#Rconc-tools)
* [Testing tools](???)

There are many other kinds of tools, such as source code depositories, build tools, etc.,
but those are beyond the scope of these guidelines.

##### Note

Be careful not to become dependent on over-elaborate or over-specialized tool chains.
Those can make your otherwise portable code non-portable.
