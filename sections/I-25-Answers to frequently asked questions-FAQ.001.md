### <a name="Faq-aims"></a>FAQ.1: What do these guidelines aim to achieve?

See the <a href="#S-abstract">top of this page</a>. This is an open source project to maintain modern authoritative guidelines for writing C++ code using the current C++ Standard (as of this writing, C++14). The guidelines are designed to be modern, machine-enforceable wherever possible, and open to contributions and forking so that organizations can easily incorporate them into their own corporate coding guidelines.
