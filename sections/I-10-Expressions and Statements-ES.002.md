### <a name="Res-abstr"></a>ES.2: Prefer suitable abstractions to direct use of language features

##### Reason

A "suitable abstraction" (e.g., library or class) is closer to the application concepts than the bare language, leads to shorter and clearer code, and is likely to be better tested.

##### Example

    vector<string> read1(istream& is)   // good
    {
        vector<string> res;
        for (string s; is >> s;)
            res.push_back(s);
        return res;
    }

The more traditional and lower-level near-equivalent is longer, messier, harder to get right, and most likely slower:

    char** read2(istream& is, int maxelem, int maxstring, int* nread)   // bad: verbose and incomplete
    {
        auto res = new char*[maxelem];
        int elemcount = 0;
        while (is && elemcount < maxelem) {
            auto s = new char[maxstring];
            is.read(s, maxstring);
            res[elemcount++] = s;
        }
        nread = &elemcount;
        return res;
    }

Once the checking for overflow and error handling has been added that code gets quite messy, and there is the problem remembering to `delete` the returned pointer and the C-style strings that array contains.

##### Enforcement

Not easy. ??? Look for messy loops, nested loops, long functions, absence of function calls, lack of use of non-built-in types. Cyclomatic complexity?

## ES.dcl: Declarations

A declaration is a statement. A declaration introduces a name into a scope and may cause the construction of a named object.
