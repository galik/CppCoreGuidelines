### <a name="Res-init"></a>ES.22: Don't declare a variable until you have a value to initialize it with

##### Reason

Readability. Limit the scope in which a variable can be used. Don't risk used-before-set. Initialization is often more efficient than assignment.

##### Example, bad

    string s;
    // ... no use of s here ...
    s = "what a waste";

##### Example, bad

    SomeLargeType var;   // ugly CaMeLcAsEvArIaBlE

    if (cond)   // some non-trivial condition
        Set(&var);
    else if (cond2 || !cond3) {
        var = Set2(3.14);
    }
    else {
        var = 0;
        for (auto& e : something)
            var += e;
    }

    // use var; that this isn't done too early can be enforced statically with only control flow

This would be fine if there was a default initialization for `SomeLargeType` that wasn't too expensive.
Otherwise, a programmer might very well wonder if every possible path through the maze of conditions has been covered.
If not, we have a "use before set" bug. This is a maintenance trap.

For initializers of moderate complexity, including for `const` variables, consider using a lambda to express the initializer; see [ES.28](I-10-Expressions%20and%20Statements-ES.028.md#Res-lambda-init).

##### Enforcement

* Flag declarations with default initialization that are assigned to before they are first read.
* Flag any complicated computation after an uninitialized variable and before its use.
