### <a name="Rconc-lockfree"></a>CP.100: Don't use lock-free programming unless you absolutely have to

##### Reason

It's error-prone and requires expert level knowledge of language features, machine architecture, and data structures.

##### Example, bad

    extern atomic<Link*> head;        // the shared head of a linked list

    Link* nh = new Link(data, nullptr);    // make a link ready for insertion
    Link* h = head.load();                 // read the shared head of the list

    do {
        if (h->data <= data) break;        // if so, insert elsewhere
        nh->next = h;                      // next element is the previous head
    } while (!head.compare_exchange_weak(h, nh));    // write nh to head or to h

Spot the bug.
It would be really hard to find through testing.
Read up on the ABA problem.

##### Exception

[Atomic variables](#???) can be used simply and safely, as long as you are using the sequentially consistent memory model (memory_order_seq_cst), which is the default.

##### Note

Higher-level concurrency mechanisms, such as `thread`s and `mutex`es are implemented using lock-free programming.

**Alternative**: Use lock-free data structures implemented by others as part of some library.
