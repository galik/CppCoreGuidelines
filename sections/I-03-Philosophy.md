The rules in this section are very general.

Philosophy rules summary:

* [P.1: Express ideas directly in code](I-03-Philosophy-P.001.md#Rp-direct)
* [P.2: Write in ISO Standard C++](I-03-Philosophy-P.002.md#Rp-Cplusplus)
* [P.3: Express intent](I-03-Philosophy-P.003.md#Rp-what)
* [P.4: Ideally, a program should be statically type safe](I-03-Philosophy-P.004.md#Rp-typesafe)
* [P.5: Prefer compile-time checking to run-time checking](I-03-Philosophy-P.005.md#Rp-compile-time)
* [P.6: What cannot be checked at compile time should be checkable at run time](I-03-Philosophy-P.006.md#Rp-run-time)
* [P.7: Catch run-time errors early](I-03-Philosophy-P.007.md#Rp-early)
* [P.8: Don't leak any resources](I-03-Philosophy-P.008.md#Rp-leak)
* [P.9: Don't waste time or space](I-03-Philosophy-P.009.md#Rp-waste)
* [P.10: Prefer immutable data to mutable data](I-03-Philosophy-P.010.md#Rp-mutable)
* [P.11: Encapsulate messy constructs, rather than spreading through the code](I-03-Philosophy-P.011.md#Rp-library)
* [P.12: Use supporting tools as appropriate](I-03-Philosophy-P.012.md#Rp-tools)
* [P.13: Use support libraries as appropriate](I-03-Philosophy-P.013.md#Rp-lib)

Philosophical rules are generally not mechanically checkable.
However, individual rules reflecting these philosophical themes are.
Without a philosophical basis, the more concrete/specific/checkable rules lack rationale.
