### <a name="Rt-lib"></a>T.125: If you need to go beyond the standard-library TMP facilities, use an existing library

##### Reason

Getting advanced TMP facilities is not easy and using a library makes you part of a (hopefully supportive) community.
Write your own "advanced TMP support" only if you really have to.

##### Example

```cpp
???

```
##### Enforcement
