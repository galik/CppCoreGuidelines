### <a name="Faq-markdown"></a>FAQ.10: What version of Markdown do these guidelines use?

These coding standards are written using [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org), and `<a>` HTML anchors.

We are considering the following extensions from [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/):

* fenced code blocks (consistently using indented vs. fenced is under discussion)
* tables (none yet but we'll likely need them, and this is a GFM extension)

Avoid other HTML tags and other extensions.

Note: We are not yet consistent with this style.
