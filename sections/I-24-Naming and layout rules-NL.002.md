### <a name="Rl-comments-intent"></a>NL.2: State intent in comments

##### Reason

Code says what is done, not what is supposed to be done. Often intent can be stated more clearly and concisely than the implementation.

##### Example

```cpp
void stable_sort(Sortable& c)
    // sort c in the order determined by <, keep equal elements (as defined by ==) in
    // their original relative order
{
    // ... quite a few lines of non-trivial code ...
}

```
##### Note

If the comment and the code disagrees, both are likely to be wrong.
