### <a name="Rl-comments"></a>NL.1: Don't say in comments what can be clearly stated in code

##### Reason

Compilers do not read comments.
Comments are less precise than code.
Comments are not updated as consistently as code.

##### Example, bad

    auto x = m * v1 + vv;   // multiply m with v1 and add the result to vv

##### Enforcement

Build an AI program that interprets colloquial English text and see if what is said could be better expressed in C++.
