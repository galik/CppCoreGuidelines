### <a name="Re-design-invariants"></a>E.4: Design your error-handling strategy around invariants

##### Reason

To use an object it must be in a valid state (defined formally or informally by an invariant) and to recover from an error every object not destroyed must be in a valid state.

##### Note

An [invariant](I-06-Classes and Class Hierarchies-C.002.md#Rc-struct) is logical condition for the members of an object that a constructor must establish for the public member functions to assume.

##### Enforcement
