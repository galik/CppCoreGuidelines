# <a name="S-stdlib"></a>SL: The Standard Library

Using only the bare language, every task is tedious (in any language).
Using a suitable library any task can be reasonably simple.

The standard library has steadily grown over the years.
Its description in the standard is now larger than that of the language features.
So, it is likely that this library section of the guidelines will eventually grow in size to equal or exceed all the rest.
