### <a name="Rl-space"></a>NL.15: Use spaces sparingly

##### Reason

Too much space makes the text larger and distracts.

##### Example, bad

    #include < map >

    int main(int argc, char * argv [ ])
    {
        // ...
    }

##### Example

    #include <map>

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
        // ...
    }

##### Note

Some IDEs have their own opinions and add distracting space.

##### Note

We value well-placed whitespace as a significant help for readability. Just don't overdo it.
