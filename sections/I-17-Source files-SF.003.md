### <a name="Rs-declaration-header"></a>SF.3: Use `.h` files for all declarations used in multiple source files

##### Reason

Maintainability. Readability.

##### Example, bad

    // bar.cpp:
    void bar() { cout << "bar\n"; }

    // foo.cpp:
    extern void bar();
    void foo() { bar(); }

A maintainer of `bar` cannot find all declarations of `bar` if its type needs changing.
The user of `bar` cannot know if the interface used is complete and correct. At best, error messages come (late) from the linker.

##### Enforcement

* Flag declarations of entities in other source files not placed in a `.h`.
