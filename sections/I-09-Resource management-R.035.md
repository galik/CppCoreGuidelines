### <a name="Rr-sharedptrparam"></a>R.35: Take a `shared_ptr<widget>&` parameter to express that a function might reseat the shared pointer

##### Reason

This makes the function's reseating explicit.

##### Note

"reseat" means "making a reference or a smart pointer refer to a different object."

##### Example, good

```cpp
void share(shared_ptr<widget>);            // share -- "will" retain refcount

void reseat(shared_ptr<widget>&);          // "might" reseat ptr

void may_share(const shared_ptr<widget>&); // "might" retain refcount

```
##### Enforcement

* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` parameter by lvalue reference and does not either assign to it or call `reset()` on it on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by value or by reference to `const` and does not copy or move it to another `Shared_ptr` on at least one code path. Suggest taking a `T*` or `T&` instead.
* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn if a function takes a `Shared_ptr<T>` by rvalue reference. Suggesting taking it by value instead.
