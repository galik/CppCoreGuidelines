# <a name="S-cpl"></a>CPL: C-style programming

C and C++ are closely related languages.
They both originate in "Classic C" from 1978 and have evolved in ISO committees since then.
Many attempts have been made to keep them compatible, but neither is a subset of the other.

C rule summary:

* [CPL.1: Prefer C++ to C](I-16-C-style programming-CPL.001.md#Rcpl-C)
* [CPL.2: If you must use C, use the common subset of C and C++, and compile the C code as C++](I-16-C-style programming-CPL.002.md#Rcpl-subset)
* [CPL.3: If you must use C for interfaces, use C++ in the code using such interfaces](I-16-C-style programming-CPL.003.md#Rcpl-interface)
