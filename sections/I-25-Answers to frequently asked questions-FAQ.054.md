### <a name="Faq-gsl-iso"></a>FAQ.54: Has the GSL (guideline support library) been approved by the ISO C++ standards committee?

No. The GSL exists only to supply a few types and aliases that are not currently in the standard library. If the committee decides on standardized versions (of these or other types that fill the same need) then they can be removed from the GSL.
