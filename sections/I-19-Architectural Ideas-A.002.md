### <a name="Ra-lib"></a>A.2: Express potentially reusable parts as a library

##### Reason

##### Note

A library is a collection of declarations and definitions maintained, documented, and shipped together.
A library could be a set of headers (a "header only library") or a set of headers plus a set of object files.
A library can be statically or dynamically linked into a program, or it may be `#included`
